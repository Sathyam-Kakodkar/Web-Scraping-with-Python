# Web Scraping Website with Python

In this project, I have scraped data from the website named Screener which stores all the stock market data of NSE. BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries were used for scraping the data from the website. Scraped data was saved in a variable named data. This data can be later used for analysis.


Url --> [www.screener.in](https://www.screener.in/screens/214283/companies-creating-new-high/?page=1)

Note: The number of pages and data on the website will be updated.
